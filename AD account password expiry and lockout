There was "Login failed. The login is from untrusted domain and cannot be used with windows authentication" error from an app. 

This was due to password rotation(recycle) made a day before. It needed to be reapplied. 

Here is where to check the password related information using powershell
-- Substitute "ADAccountName" with the proper name but don't put domain\ e.g. svc-sqlsvr (not domain\svc-sqlsvr)

Import-Module ActiveDirectory

get-aduser -identity <ADAccountName> -properties * | select accountexpirationdate, accountexpires, accountlockouttime, badlogoncount, padpwdcount, lastbadpasswordattempt, lastlogondate, lockedout, passwordexpired, passwordlastset, pwdlastset | format-list

To unlock 
Unlock-ADAccount <username>


Want to check all accounts expired or locked?

Search-ADAccount -Locked | select name, LockedOut, LastLogonData
More commands
Search-ADAccount -AccountExpired
Search-ADAccount -AccountDisabled
Search-ADAccount -AccountInactive
Get-Help Search-ADAccount -ShowWindow
